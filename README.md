# Schrodinger-Differential-Equation-Solver

Simple and accurate numerical technique for finding eigenvalues, node structure,
and expectation values of PT-symmetric potentials is devised. The approach involves
expanding the solution to the Schr\ Ìˆodinger equation in series involving powers of both
the coordinate and the energy. The technique is designed to allow one to impose boundary conditions in
PT-symmetric pairs of Stokes sectors. The method is illustrated by using many examples of PT--symmetric potentials in both the unbroken-and broken-PT-symmetric regions.
